## Overview

An academic CV (Curriculum Vitae) is a comprehensive document detailing your academic and professional history. Unlike a resume (typically 1-2 pages for industry), a CV is longer and more detailed, typically:
- **2-4 pages** for early-career professionals (PhD students, recent graduates)
- **4-7 pages** for mid-career professionals (postdocs, assistant professors)
- **10+ pages** for senior faculty with extensive publications

---

## General Principles

### From MIT Career Advising & Professional Development (CAPD)

**Strategic Development:**
- Maintain two CVs: an authoritative master CV with all information, and tailored versions for specific positions
- Place your 3-4 most notable skills, achievements, and knowledge areas prominently
- Material presented early in your CV stands out more (except publications, which are often at the end)
- Consider your audience: adjust technical vocabulary and focus based on the position

**Content Philosophy:**
- Completeness is more important than brevity
- Unlike resumes, it's appropriate to describe both teaching and research in detail
- Include goal, contributions, and impact/results for each experience
- Tailor section order based on position type

**Key Differences: Academic CV vs. Industry Resume**

| Aspect | Academic CV | Industry Resume |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| Length | Comprehensive (2-10+ pages) | Concise (1-2 pages) |
| Focus | Scholarly record | Value added, efficiency |
| Key Elements | Research, teaching, publications | Skills, achievements, metrics |
| Updates | Continuously throughout career | Tailored per application |
